            <p id="skip-to-main" tabindex="-1"> The Arc de Triomphe is located on the Champs-Élysées. If you would like to the top of the monument, you will have to purchase tickets, travel underneath the traffic through an underground tunnel, and climb 40 stairs. While you are there, the shopping and food near the Champs-Élysées is excellent. </p>

            <p> The Conciergerie has a long history. It first served as a Gothic palace, then the building served a judicial role, and finally, the building was a revolutionary prison.

            <img src="images/louvre.jpg" alt="Image of the Louvre" class = "pages-image">
            <p> The Louvre is a world-renowned art museum. Of course there is the Mona Lisa, but there are also other exhibits. These exhibits include the Egyptian Antiquities, Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities, Near Eastern Antiquities, Islamic Art, Paintings, Sculptures, Decorative Arts, and Prints and Drawings. My favorite thing to see in the Louvre is the Medieval Louvre exhibit, which is the original ruins of the castle that existed from 1190 until the 1500s. </p>
