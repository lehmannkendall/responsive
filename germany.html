              <p id="skip-to-main" tabindex="-1"> Neuschwanstein or the castle of the fairy-tale king is one of the most popular castles in Europe.  You can only visit Neuschwanstein Castle with a guided tour, which you should book in advance. I would recommend taking the shuttle bus from the ticket office up to the Castle, as it is a 40 minute walk uphill. </p>

              <p> There are no regular guided tours at Nymphenburg, but audio guides are offered. You can tour the North Apartment, South Apartment, Queen’s Apartment, and Palace Chapel. From April to October you can even enjoy gondola rides on the central canal. </p>

              <p> Hofbrauhaus is one of the world’s most famous beer halls and is located in Munich. It was built almost 500 years ago and continues to offer German beer and food. There is also often live German music. If you want a true German experience, you should have a meal here. </p>

              <p> Munich Frauenkirche is a Catholic Church also referred to The Catholic Church of Our Blessed Lady. It is Munich’s largest church and a major landmark of the city, as there is a height ordinance to prevent taller buildings. The towers were finished in 1488 and the domes were added in 1525. The most interesting part of the church is the Devil’s Footstep, which is a black mark that resembles a footprint. </p>
